<h3>
Each year, thousands of people rely on receiving donated blood and blood products to stay alive.
Certain injuries and illnesses can quickly cause a person's blood levels to drop. Without enough blood, they will not receive enough oxygen in their body, resulting in death.
</h3><h3>
Many hospitals and medical centers utilize donated blood to save the lives of their patients.

While a blood donation can be vital for some people, what are the effects on those who donate the blood? In this article, we take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of giving blood.

<h3>Advantages</h3><br>
While donated blood is beneficial for people in need, some medical professionals maintain that donating blood also benefits the donor.

<h4>Reduces iron levels</h4>
Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce red blood cells. However, too much iron can be harmful to a person's health. It can deposit into different organs of the body, such as the liver and heart, and affect the way those organs function.
<br>
<h4>Identifies adverse health effects</h4>
Each person who donates blood completes a simply physical examination and short blood test before giving blood.

As a result, it is possible that a person could identify unknown health concerns as a part of the blood donation process. These health issues could include blood pressure concerns or low blood counts.

A person should never use donating blood to find out if they have any blood-borne diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Instead, they should always go to their doctor with any concerns they have.

Although low blood counts would stop a person from donating, discovering this information could help them pursue more information about their health.
<br>
<h4>Helps people feel good about themselves</h4>
Donating blood has the power to impact up to three people who need the blood to survive.

Knowing that they have made a difference to the lives of others can relieve a person's stress and make them feel mentally well or better about themselves than they did before.
<br>
<h4>Burns calories</h4>
Donating blood burns up to 650 calories per donation, according to the St. Mary's Medical Center, Blue Springs, MO. While giving blood should not be an alternative to exercise, the calories burned might be seen as of occasional benefit by some.

<h3>Disadvantages</h3><br>
When performed in a clean manner, donating blood is safe.

If a blood bank were to reuse needles, this could increase the risk of someone experiencing a blood-borne infection.
<br>
For this reason, it is part of routine blood collection to use new needles for each donation and to require every person involved to wash their hands.
<br>
A person can experience some side effects, as a result of donating blood. These include:
<br><h5>
Dizziness  <br>
Feeling faint<br>
Lightheadedness<br>
Nausea<br>
</h5>
<h4>These symptoms will usually go away within 3 days of giving blood.</h4>
